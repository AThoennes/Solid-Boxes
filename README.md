# Solid Boxes

The files SolidBoxes.java and DrawSolidBoxes.java rely upon each other. The other files were testing files for writing the primitive type char and spaces for the formatting of the output. 

This program takes in the dimensions of a box (height and width) and prints them out according to the given dimensions. In addition to the previous line, the program SolidBoxes.java asks the user for a type of keyboard character to use to render the boxes. This was my 4th assignment for CMPS.
